                <h1>JavaScript (/'dʒavəskript/),</h1>
                <h5 style="text-align:left;">
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular
                    for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
                    lightweight langunge allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different
                    directions, JavaScript lives inside a host
                    environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments
                    to provide programmatic control ove
                    them
                    • Variable Declaration JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup
                    you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                    a variable bolds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names, These
                    unique names are called identifiers. Var X;
                    Variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now
                    have coffee poured in it, giving our
                    varable a value to hold. The a assignment operator assigns a value to a vanable, var X = I0
                    • Data Types Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to
                    know the data type. There are six data types
                    that are JavaScript primitives: Boolcan - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or
                    3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!":
                    Array - [1, 'Coding, 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - (first _name: 'Jane', last_name: Doe')
                    Conditionals When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions -
                    hitting different code blocks based on
                    Values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to
                    accomplish this. There are the fOllowing
                    coDdIdOnal stakeincats: 11 a specilled CODdition is true, do this code in Our Code block: else i to
                    specify a new condition to testathe fint
                    condition is aIse; else we execute this DIock of code,
                    Loops There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all
                    essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
                    an action some number Of times. Imagine yOu have to run a mile, well you run around the track 1our
                    times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                    Function Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run
                    that code block. Think of it as a list of
                    instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the
                    instruction manual and get started, first we
                    screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our
                    instructions, Sadly there are a ton more
                    tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again
