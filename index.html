                    [10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies
                    of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the
                    client side for web
                    page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a
                    dedicated JavaScript
                    engine to execute the code on users' devices.

                    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                    standard.[14] It has
                    dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
                    supporting
                    event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
                    interfaces (APIs) for
                    working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object
                    Model (DOM).

                    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                    graphics facilities. In
                    practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

                    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some
                    servers and a variety
                    of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

                    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
                    languages are
                    distinct and differ greatly in design.
